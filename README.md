## 💻 Installation & Usage

This project uses `npm` for dependency management.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

This starts a local development server at `http://localhost:3000`. Most changes are reflected live without restarting the server.

### 3. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates static content into the `build` directory.
