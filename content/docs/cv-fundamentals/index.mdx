# Computer Vision Fundamentals

The building blocks of vision systems, from raw pixel manipulation to extracting meaningful features.

## 🧩 Convolution Kernels

Convolution is the fundamental operation behind filtering and CNNs. See how different kernels affect feature extraction.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Image Filtering
- **Smoothing**: Reducing noise using Gaussian blur.
- **Sharpening**: Enhancing edges and details.

### 2. Morphological Operations
- **Erosion/Dilation**: expanding or shrinking shapes.
- **Opening/Closing**: Removing noise or filling gaps.

### 3. Feature Detectors
- **Harris Corner**: Identifying corners based on intensity gradients.
- **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)**: Describing object shapes for detection.
