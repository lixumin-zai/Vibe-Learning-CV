## Basics
- **Image Representation**: Understanding pixels, channels (RGB, HSV, LAB), and simple operations.
- **Projective Geometry**: Homography, camera models, and calibration.

## Processing
- **Filtering**: Gaussian, Median, and Bilateral filtering.
- **Edge Detection**: Sobel, Canny, and finding contours.

## Features
- **Keypoints**: SIFT, SURF, ORB.
- **Matching**: BFMatcher, FLANN, and RANSAC for robust estimation.
